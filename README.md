Short Story: "Juliet wouldn't have killed herself if she had a Sassy gay friend"

-> Observe the following dialogue:
Juliet: I love him.
Sassy gay friend: You love him?! You met him sunday. It's barely thursday morning. Slow down, crazy, slow down!
Juliet: Love makes you crazy.
Sassy gay friend: Yeah I would say so! "Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?" Translation: "Desperate, desperate, I am really desperate!"
Juliet: I am a grown woman.
Sassy gay friend: I think you're 14 and an idiote. You took a roofie from a priest. Look at your life, look at your choices, have you even slept with this guy? 
Juliet: I did. 
Sassy gay friend: You big slut, good for you!

*Sassy gay friend and Juliet high-five each other*
